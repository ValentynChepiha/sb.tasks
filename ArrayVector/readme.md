Common requirements:

    1) Your class must be placed to the same package as the 
       interface: ru.skillbench.tasks.basics.math.
    2) Your class must be named ArrayVectorImpl.
    3) Your class must be public and implement the given interface, 
       i.e. the class definition must be as follows:

```
public class ArrayVectorImpl implements ArrayVector
{ ... }
```

    4) Your class must have a public no-argument constructor that 
       means either the default constructor (the absence of any 
       constructors in your code) or the presence of the following code:

```
public ArrayVectorImpl(){ ... }
```

    5) Your class must not have compilation errors (write your
       code in IDE).
    6) Instantiation with the no-argument constructor must not fail 
       (it's recommended to test it by main() method or by JUnit).
